This mod will convert the Kerbol System into the (Real) Solar System.

Thanks to asmi for kicking me into to doing this and offering so much help along the way; to ferram for aeronautics and orbital help (and FAR, which is essential), and for countless time spent helping others get the most from this mod (and me the most from my modding); to ZRM for many ideas and info; to yargnit and MedievalNerd for playtesting extraordinaire; to everyone else who offered suggestions, code, help, cool screenshots...

Supreme thanks to all who helped make RSS possible! regex for code, and dimonnomid and SpacedInvader for incredible art for RSS, and pingopete for his work on RSS - EVE interoperability and atmosphere work for RSS, and KillAshley for making RSS so much better (and prettier!). RSS would not look or perform the way it does (or have gotten released!) without their amazing contributions. Thanks to stratochief and grayduster and Thomas P. for wonderful help in converting to Kopernicus and adding the new bodies--with their help RSS has entered a new era!

INSTALLATION:
Install the above dependencies, as per the instructions of each one, to KSP/GameData.
Extract RealSolarSystem to KSP/GameData. You should now have one .dll (Module Manager) in the root of GameData, and two folders: Kopernicus and RealSolarSystem. However, you are NOT DONE YET.

TEXTURE INSTALLATION:
Now, you must select a texture resolution. Download a premade pack (8192, 4096, or 2048) and then, if desired, selectively replace with different-resolution textures. Note that 8192 is dangerous, since you may easily run out of memory.

You can get the textures from: https://github.com/KSP-RO/ScaledRSS-Textures
Go to the releases page and grab one of the resolution packs, then (optionally) get replacements from the repository itself).
NOTE: The folder is "RSS-Textures"
